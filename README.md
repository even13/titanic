# Titanic

This is a small ruby program that outputs the survival rates of passengers of the Titanic.  

The csv file containing passenger data was taken from Kaggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on kaggle.com.

The script outputs:
- the survival rate for all passengers
- the survival rate for women
- the survival rate for men
- the survival rate for 1st, 2nd and 3rd class passengers

To use it, run ```bundle install``` first.

To execute the code: ```ruby lib/titanic.rb```

To run the tests: ```bundle exec rspec```
